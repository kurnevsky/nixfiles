 Usage:
 - You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. 
-- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.
+- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces).
 - ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
 - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
 - The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error "oldString not found in content".

 - By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
 - You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
 - Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
-- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
+- Results are returned as plain text without line numbers
 - This tool cannot read binary files, including images
 - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful. 
 - If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
